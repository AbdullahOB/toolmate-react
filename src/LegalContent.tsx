const SafetyPolicyMd = `# Safety Guidelines

At ToolMate, your safety is our top priority. Whether you're a seasoned DIY expert or just starting out, using the right tools and following safety protocols is essential to completing projects successfully and without injury. These guidelines are designed to help you stay safe while you tackle your DIY tasks with confidence.

By using ToolMate, you agree to follow these safety recommendations. Always prioritize safety when working on projects, and if you're unsure about any aspect of tool use or project execution, seek professional advice.

---

## 1. Wear Appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

Protective gear is vital when working with tools and materials. Depending on the task, we recommend using the following:

- **Safety Glasses or Goggles**: Protect your eyes from flying debris, dust, or sparks.
- **Ear Protection**: Use earplugs or earmuffs when working with loud power tools to prevent hearing damage.
- **Gloves**: Wear appropriate gloves to protect your hands from cuts, chemicals, and abrasions.
- **Dust Masks or Respirators**: Use masks or respirators when working in dusty environments or with chemicals.
- **Safety Shoes**: Choose shoes with reinforced toes (like steel-toe boots) to protect your feet from falling objects.
- **High-Visibility Clothing**: If working in a busy or dimly lit area, wear high-visibility vests to stay easily seen by others.

---

## 2. Understand Your Tools

Before using any tool, make sure you:

- **Read the Manual**: Always familiarize yourself with the manufacturer’s instructions for the tool you're using. Follow the guidelines for setup, operation, and maintenance.
- **Inspect the Tool**: Check for any signs of wear, damage, or malfunction before using the tool. Faulty equipment can lead to accidents.
- **Use the Right Tool for the Job**: Always select the correct tool for the task at hand. Using the wrong tool can cause accidents or damage the material you're working on.

---

## 3. Keep Your Workspace Clean and Organized

- **Clear Clutter**: A tidy workspace reduces the risk of tripping or knocking over objects. Keep your work area organized, and remove any unnecessary tools or materials.
- **Ensure Good Lighting**: Proper lighting is essential for accuracy and safety. Make sure your workspace is well-lit to prevent accidents.
- **Secure Your Work**: Use clamps or vices to secure materials you're working on, preventing them from shifting unexpectedly.

---

## 4. Maintain Focus and Awareness

- **Stay Alert**: Focus on the task at hand and avoid distractions while working with tools. Always be aware of your surroundings.
- **Avoid Fatigue**: Tiredness can impair judgment and reaction times. Take regular breaks, and if you feel fatigued, stop working until you are well-rested.
- **Do Not Rush**: Take your time to ensure accuracy and safety. Rushing increases the risk of mistakes and accidents.

---

## 5. Electrical Safety

- **Inspect Cords and Plugs**: Always check electrical cords and plugs for damage before use. Do not use tools with frayed or exposed wiring.
- **Use Grounded Outlets**: Always plug power tools into grounded outlets, or use ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCI) when working outdoors or in damp environments.
- **Keep Water Away**: Never use electrical tools near water or in damp conditions unless the tool is specifically designed for such use.

---

## 6. Ladder Safety

- **Inspect the Ladder**: Check your ladder for damage before using it. Make sure it’s on a stable, even surface.
- **Maintain Three Points of Contact**: Always have two hands and one foot, or two feet and one hand, in contact with the ladder when climbing.
- **Do Not Overreach**: Move the ladder if necessary rather than overreaching, which can cause you to lose balance and fall.

---

## 7. Power Tool Safety

- **Disconnect When Not in Use**: Unplug or remove the battery from power tools when they are not in use or when changing blades or bits.
- **Use Safety Guards**: Never remove or bypass safety guards on power tools. They are there to protect you from injury.
- **Avoid Loose Clothing**: Ensure that no loose clothing, jewelry, or hair can get caught in moving parts of power tools.

---

## 8. Proper Lifting Techniques

- **Lift with Your Legs, Not Your Back**: When lifting heavy objects, bend your knees and lift with your legs to avoid straining your back.
- **Get Help for Heavy Loads**: If an object is too heavy or awkward to lift alone, ask for help or use lifting equipment like dollies or carts.

---

## 9. Keep Children and Pets Away

- **Restricted Access**: Make sure your workspace is off-limits to children and pets while tools are in use. Tools and materials can pose significant risks.
- **Unplug and Store Safely**: After finishing a project, unplug all tools and store them out of reach of children.

---

## 10. Know When to Call a Professional

While DIY can be rewarding, there are some projects that require professional expertise. If you are unsure about any task, or if it involves complex electrical, plumbing, or structural work, we strongly recommend seeking the help of a licensed professional.

---

## Final Note

ToolMate is here to guide and support you through your DIY projects, but your safety depends on following these guidelines and exercising caution. Always prioritize safety over speed or convenience, and if you ever feel uncertain about a tool or project, take the time to research or consult a professional.

For any questions or further guidance, feel free to reach out to us at **contact@toolmate.com**.

Stay safe and enjoy your DIY journey!
